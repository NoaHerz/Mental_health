# Mental health project

Many of the epilepsy patients we collected data from throughout the DARPA project represent an enriched sample of mental health comorbidities.  
This is a retrospective analysis of the data while taking patients' mental health conditions into account (depression, anxiety, PTSD) to reveal interesting insights about memory performance in these conditions as well as their underlying electrophysiology.
